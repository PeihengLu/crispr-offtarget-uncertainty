# Learning to quantify uncertainty in off-target activity for CRISPR guide RNAs

> crispAI is a deep learning-based tool that predicts the off-target cleavage activity for a given single guide RNA (sgRNA) and target DNA sequence pair and quantifies the uncertainty in off-target cleavage activity.
> crispAI-aggregate is an uncertainty aware genome-wide specificity score for sgRNA's.
